""Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k.

Return the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.

 

Example 1:

Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,13,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
Example 2:

Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.""

class Solution:
    def findKthPositive(self, arr: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        low=0
        high=len(arr)-1
        
        while low<=high:
            
            mid=(low+high)//2
            if arr[mid]-(mid+1)<k:
                low=mid+1
            else:
                high=mid-1
        
        return (low+k)
