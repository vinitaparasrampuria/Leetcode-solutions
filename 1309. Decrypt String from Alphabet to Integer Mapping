""You are given a string s formed by digits and '#'. We want to map s to English lowercase characters as follows:

Characters ('a' to 'i') are represented by ('1' to '9') respectively.
Characters ('j' to 'z') are represented by ('10#' to '26#') respectively.
Return the string formed after mapping.

The test cases are generated so that a unique mapping will always exist.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "10#11#12"
Output: "jkab"
Explanation: "j" -> "10#" , "k" -> "11#" , "a" -> "1" , "b" -> "2".
Example 2:

Input: s = "1326#"
Output: "acz"""

class Solution:
    def freqAlphabets(self, s: str) -> str:
        
        i=0
        res=""
        
        while i<len(s):
            
            if i<len(s)-2 and s[i+2]=='#':
                res+=chr(int(s[i:i+2])+ord('a')-1)
                i+=3
            else:
                res+=chr(int(s[i])+ord('a')-1)
                i+=1
     
        return res
